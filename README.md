# Thingy bot
This bot acts as a channel gatekeeper for people to answer questions and be let into my personal channel!

This bot matches the theme of spooky because it utilizes jumpscares and is very spooky when you get the quiz questions wrong! Also the profile pic of the bot is Monika, whose from Doki Doki Literature Club, a horror game.

## Description: 
Use the button (https://slack.com/shortcuts/Ft09Q1PCDDEZ/7e71c5324c355c682890e703d81718f5) to get started! Solve the quiz questions, answer the free responses, and submit! Just try not to get jump-scared too much...

After submitting the form, the bot will auto-add you to my public personal channel, and send a confirmation DM to you with details about the channel and info on my @Jester bot! It will also send a DM to me with your answers (and if I really like you, I'll add you to my private channel)!
